I'm currently a software engineer at Relaxdays, building things for the logistics with some great people. I recently graduated from Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg with bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, specialising in optimisation algorithms. As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between technical engineering and real processes in the field.

If I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably out for a walk, playing games on my Steam Deck or reading books about Zamonia.
